Hello {{ to_user.first }},

MENA Devs was first launched in January, 2015 with the purpose of
connecting Software Developers, Designers and Computer Enthusiasts in the
MENA region. What started as a Slack group has evolved to become a vibrant
community of 190+ members engaging in daily discussions in software, and
web development, tools of the trade, work methodologies and workflows, and
technical management styles (to name a few of the popular topics).

We are looking forward to your active contributions to the community while
appreciating you following our basic guidelines and Code of Conduct (CoC) [
https://github.com/mena-devs/code-of-conduct]:

   - Respect other members of the group and let this CoC guide your actions.
   - Do not insult and engage in degrading behaviours towards any member as
   these actions will not be tolerated.
   - We encourage freedom of speech and we will try to avoid content
   censoring, however, apply the utmost consideration for the content
   discussed or shared by flagging NSFW material, avoiding profanities, and
   avoiding malicious commentary.
   - Avoid spamming at all cost and / or the abuse of private details of
   members. Examples of information abuse are, but not limited to: Sharing
   members' contact information with any 3rd party, Use members' details for
   sales / promotional purposes, Sharing the content of private discussions on
   external platforms, etc.
   - As a result of breaking any of the rules above, a ban will immediately
   be applied by an admin after internal deliberation and the delivery of a
   formal and final warning. The ban is permanent and is not up for debate.

Finally, admittance to the group will always remain invitation only. If you
wish to invite other people, you can reach out with a private message to
one of the 6 active admins ({{ admins.first_names }}) with contact details of
the invitee (Full name, and Email address). The inviting party (you) should
know the invitee in person and introduce them on Slack (under the
#introductions channel) once they accept the invitation and join the group.

On behalf of the MENA Devs admins,
Welcome on board and enjoy your stay!
